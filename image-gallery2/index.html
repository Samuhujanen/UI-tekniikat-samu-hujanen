              A city is a large human settlement. It can be defined as a permanent and densely settled place with administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily
              on non-agricultural tasks. Cities generally have extensive systems for housing, transportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, production of goods, and
               communication. Their density facilitates interaction between people, government organisations and businesses, sometimes benefiting different parties in the process, 
               such as improving efficiency of goods and service distribution.

              Other important traits of cities besides population include the capital status and relative continued occupation of the city. For example, country capitals such
               as Beijing, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Rome, Athens, Seoul, Tokyo, and Washington, D.C. reflect the identity and apex of their respective
                nations. Some historic capitals, such as Kyoto, maintain their reflection of cultural identity even without modern capital status. Religious holy sites offer another
                 example of capital status within a religion, Jerusalem, Mecca, Varanasi, Ayodhya, Haridwar and Prayagraj each hold significance. The cities of Jericho, Faiyum,
                  Damascus, Athens, Aleppo and Argos are among those laying claim to the longest continual inhabitation.
